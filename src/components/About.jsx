        I'm a lover of everything related to technology, geek world and games. That's why I got interested in development and decided to invest in this area.

        I have always enjoyed helping people, and knowing that I can work doing this has motivated me more and more to dedicate myself and seek knowledge to be able to work with that.

        I'm passionate about series and movies, and some RPG game franchises like Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher and others. I also like card games, Yugioh and Magic. I play some sports like basketball and football. I like to be with family and friends, making small talk and sometimes singing karaoke.
