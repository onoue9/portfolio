      <p>Hi, my name is Fippe pra Onoue Melo. I have 28 years old. I'm from Duque de Caxias in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
      <p>I'm a lover of everything related to technology, geek world and games. That's why I got interested in development and decided to invest in this area.</p>
      <p>I have always enjoyed helping people, and knowing that I can work doing this has motivated me more and more to dedicate myself and seek knowledge to be able to work with that.</p>
      <p>I'm passionate about series and movies, and some RPG game franchises like Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher and others. I also like card games, Yugioh and Magic. I play some sports like basketball and football. I like to be with family and friends, making small talk and sometimes singing karaoke.</p>
      <p>At the moment I'm finishing my Web Development course at Trybe, where I've already completed 3 modules, Front-end, Back-end and Logic Fundamentals.</p>
